Hello everyone,

I'm Yusuf — though many know me as *cyze*. Today, instead of walking you through a typical GitHub profile, I’d like to share a few reflections about myself and the ever-evolving digital landscape we all navigate.

Cybersecurity is a vast and uncharted ocean — one that rewards those with the courage to dive deep. But make no mistake: mastering this domain demands time, relentless curiosity, and a deep commitment to continuous learning. The internet, despite its convenience and allure, is far from innocent. Behind every bright interface may lie unseen threats. That's why it's essential to stay vigilant, question everything, and prioritize your digital safety.

To those considering a path in cybersecurity: know that this journey is about much more than cloning repositories or following trends. It’s a discipline that calls for ethical minds, persistent learners, and individuals driven by purpose. Don’t fall into the trap of being a “lamer,” and never encourage shortcuts — they only lead away from true growth.

Most importantly, understand that cybersecurity is not just a career — it's a responsibility. Use your skills to build, protect, and uplift. Let your knowledge be a force for good — for yourself, and for those around you.

**Stay curious, stay ethical, stay sharp.**

Best regards,  
**Yusuf (cyze)**
